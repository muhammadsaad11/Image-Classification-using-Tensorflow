# Image-Classification-using-Tensorflow
## Language:
-Python

## Technologies used:
-Jupyter Notebook
-Tensorflow library

## Dataset:
- Fetched from Tensorflow Keras

### Summary
In this project we are fetching images of handwritten digits, from 0 to 9. Creating and training a model over 60000 images and then testing the model if it predicts a new (black and white) image with handwritten digit on it.
